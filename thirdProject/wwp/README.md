# websiteWithPurpose


This will remain unfinished and this websites purpose and idea, looks etc will be made into a new website in the future

- I'm extending this website now that I've become more familiar with what the MERN stack is I want more practice with making websites and learning javascrip first

Website with front end and backend,, pretty, has a purpose, user friendly, stores info in session, localStorage. Has direction, and is managed from the command line
