# Learning-MernStack
This repository may contain multiple projects that will have my progress learning MERN 
(React, jsx, node, api's, packages, servers, mongo, etc) 

I've finished learning Mern Stack to a comfortable level and will create projects in their own repositories now


Notable projects from this repository ( AFTER BREAK folder)
-- use an api that tracks a deck of cards for use in making a card game, this is when I learned the most in building a foundation with react, bootstrap and persisting user data
https://github.com/ShadowDraco/Learning-MernStack/tree/main/AfterBreak/fifthProject/poker/poker-card-api

-- use an api meme generator to create and save memes to the local storage that persist, also used to view meme templates from said Api
https://github.com/ShadowDraco/Learning-MernStack/tree/main/AfterBreak/fifthProject/memes-n-stuff

-- use a web seach Api to display search results while I first learned about making requests to API, writing css by hand and learning react
https://github.com/ShadowDraco/Learning-MernStack/tree/main/AfterBreak/fifthProject/search-engine/web-search-api


- Projects with the Full MERN stack that have been deployed ( MERN PROJECTS folder )
-- custom built web chat app that allows you to log in and save chats with individual users and change users to hold multiple conversations at once.
 this one didn't make it through deployment because my practices and the platform I deployed to were inadequate, but it works between to computers running the app client side as

-- My last project, before I started learning useQuery and ReactRouter and implementing more best practices to my code. I focused on getting an app with purpose, state, persistence, log in and sign up deployed successfully, learning react bootstrap and fixing and improving upon everything that I learned while struggling through all of my previous projects!
